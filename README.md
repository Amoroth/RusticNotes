# RusticNotes

RusticNotes is a hobby and learning project for experimenting with note-taking and organizing tools using Rust and modern development practices. It's not intended for production or serious use, but rather as a playground for trying out ideas, learning Rust, and building something fun!

## Why RusticNotes?

This project exists as a way for me to:

- Learn Rust by building something practical.
- Experiment with concepts in note-taking apps.
- Explore best practices in Rust application development.

## Not for Production

RusticNotes is not intended for serious or production use. There are likely bugs, unfinished features, and breaking changes. Please use at your own risk!
